# 👤 Profiles & Badges Documentation

> **Note**: Most profile and pet commands are currently **Prefix-Only** (`.command`) to reduce slash command clutter.

Customization is a core part of the Marceline experience, allowing users to build a unique identity within the server.

## 🪪 User Profiles

The `.profile` (Alias: `.p`) command displays a comprehensive card for each user, including:
- **Level & XP**: Current progress in the server's ranking system.
- **Marriage Status**: Displays your partner and a 💍 emoji.
- **Yui Relationship**: Your current standing with the bot (e.g., "In Love", "Arch-Nemesis").
- **Reputation (Rep)**: Social points given by other members.
- **Badges**: A row of custom icons earned or purchased.
- **Pet Status**: Information about the user's active virtual pet.
- **Customization**: Users can use `.editprofile` to change their bio and profile theme.

## 🏅 Badges & Shop

Users can display their achievements through permanent profile badges.
- **Earning Badges**: Some badges are awarded for milestones (e.g., anniversary, top talker).
- **Badge Shop**: Use `.badgeshop` to browse and purchase exclusive emoji badges using XP.
- **Managing Badges**: Use `.badges` to select which earned badges to display on your profile.

### 🌟 Special Badges
These exclusive badges cannot be purchased and are awarded manually by the **Bot Owner** for significant contributions or status. Unlike shop badges, these are **Cross-Server** and will appear on your profile in every server Marceline is in.
- **MetOwner**: Awarded to those who have met the bot owner.
- **BetaTester**: For users who helped test and refine Marceline's features.
- **BotDeveloper**: Exclusive badge for those who contribute to the bot's development.
