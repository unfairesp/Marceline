# ⚙️ Custom Systems Documentation

Marceline allows server staff to create unique, automated interactions tailored to the server's specific needs.

## 📝 Custom Commands

The `/custom` command suite allows for the creation of simple "trigger-response" commands without any coding.

- **Triggers**: Commands can be set to trigger when a message "starts with" or "contains" a specific phrase.
- **Responses**: Can be plain text or professional embeds.
- **Placeholders**: Supports dynamic content like `{mention.user}`, `{user.name}`, `{server.name}`, and more.
- **Usage**: Perfect for FAQs, rules, or fun internal server memes.

## 🤖 AI Personality Tuning

Administrators can use the `/settings aipersonality` command to change how the bot's AI (Yui) speaks and behaves, making her a unique fit for the server's community.

*Custom systems provide the flexibility to make Marceline truly feel like a part of your specific server's culture.*
