# Marceline - Private Server Assistant

Marceline is a multi-purpose, high-performance Discord bot designed specifically for private server management, engagement, and advanced AI-powered interactions. This bot is a **private source** project, built to provide a seamless and feature-rich experience for its users.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Advanced AI Integration**: Powered by Hugging Face models, Marceline features a unique personality (Yui), AI-powered ModMail with FAQ capabilities, channel summarization (/recap), and vision-based image analysis.
- **Robust Moderation**: Comprehensive toolset for server staff including a dedicated ModMail ticket system with category support, infraction tracking, and automated anti-abuse systems.
- **Dynamic Economy & Leveling**: Engaging XP-based system with role-based income, daily rewards, and a variety of gambling/mini-games.
- **Personalized Profiles**: Customizable user profiles with badge shops, reputation systems, and a pet system that tracks growth and interactions.
- **Detailed Analytics**: Track message activity, voice channel usage, and peak server activity hours with visual stats.
- **Utility & Fun**: A massive collection of utility tools (QR generators, translators, currency converters) and fun commands (Roleplay, Animals, Games).

## 💡 Suggestion System (`/suggest`)

The bot features a direct line of communication between users and the server owner.

- **Command**: `/suggest`
- **Inputs**:
  - `suggestion` (String, Required): The content of your suggestion or feedback.
- **How it works**:
  - When a user runs `/suggest`, the bot creates a professional embed containing the suggestion.
  - This embed is **Directly Messaged (DM)** to the Bot Owner, ensuring that your feedback is seen personally by the administration.
  - The user receives an ephemeral confirmation that their suggestion has been delivered.
- **Example**: `/suggest Add a new channel for pet pictures!`
