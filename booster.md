# ✨ Booster Features Documentation

Marceline offers exclusive perks for users who support the server through Nitro Boosting.

## 🎭 Custom Booster Roles

The `/boosterrole` command suite allows boosters to create and manage their own unique identity in the server.

- **Create**: Boosters can create a custom role with their own choice of name and color.
- **Edit**: Change the name or color of your booster role at any time.
- **Icon**: Upload a custom icon for your role (requires appropriate server level).
- **Management**: The bot handles role placement to ensure boosters appear in the correct hierarchy.

## 🎁 Daily Bonuses

Boosters automatically receive a significantly higher "Role Income" when using the `/daily` command, rewarding their support with extra XP for use in the badge shop or games.

*These features are automatically enabled for any user with the 'Server Booster' status.*
